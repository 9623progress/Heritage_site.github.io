        <h1 id="head">Archaeological sites Nalanda Mahavihara of Nalanda</h1>
        <div class="border-top pt-4 mt-4">
            <h5>Outstanding Universal Value</h5>
            <p><strong>Brief synthesis</strong></p>
            <p>The Archaeological Site of Nalanda Mahavihara is located in the North-eastern state of Bihar, India.
                Spread over an area of 23 hectares the Archaeological site of Nalanda Mahavihara presents remains dating
                from circa. 3rd Cen BCE with one of the earliest, the largest of its time and longest serving monastic
                cum scholastic establishment in Indian Subcontinent from 5th Cen CE - 13th Cen CE before the sack and
                abandonment of Nalanda in the 13th Century. It includes stupas, chaityas, viharas, shrines, many votive
                structures and important art works in stucco, stone and metal. The layout of the buildings testifies to
                the change from grouping around the stupa-chaitya to a formal linear alignment flanking an axis from
                south to north. The historic development of the property testifies to the development of Buddhism into a
                religion and the flourishing of monastic and educational traditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Criterion</strong> <strong>(iv): </strong>The Archaeological Site of Nalanda Mahavihara
                established and developed planning, architectural, artistic principles that were adopted later by many
                similar institutions in the Indian Subcontinent, South Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>Standardisation of the architecture of viharas and the evolution of temple-like chaitya into Nalanda
                prototypes manifests the sustained interchange and patronage towards the expansion of physical
                infrastructure. The quadrangular free-standing vihara of Gandhara period evolved into a complete
                residential cum-educational infrastructure borrowed by monastic-cities of South Asia such as Paharpur,
                Vikramshila, Odantapuri and Jagaddala.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
            <p>Archaeological remains of Nalanda Mahavihara were systematically unearthed and preserved simultaneously.
                These are the most significant parts of the property that demonstrate development in planning,
                architecture and artistic tradition of Nalanda. As evinced by the surviving antiquities, the site is
                explicit of a scholar's life recorded a monastic cum scholastic establishment.</p>
           
          
            <p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p>
            <p>In subsurface condition for over seven centuries the archaeological remains of Nalanda Mahavihara were
                systematically excavated in the early 20th Cen. CE and conserved in-situ by the Archaeological Survey of
                India. Methodology adopted by the Archaeological Survey of India for the conservation and consolidation
                of its viharas and temples ensured the preservation of its historic fabric through adequate capping by
                reversible and sacrificial layers and providing supports wherever necessary. All conservation works and
                interventions are documented through photographs and drawings and published in the annual reports of
                ASI.</p>
