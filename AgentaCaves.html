            <h5>Outstanding Universal Value</h5>
            <p><strong>Brief synthesis</strong></p>
            <p>The caves at Ajanta are excavated out of a vertical cliff above the left bank of the river Waghora in the
                hills of Ajanta. They are thirty in number, including the unfinished ones, of which five (caves 9, 10,
                19, 26 and 29) are chaityagrihas (sanctuary) and the rest, sangharamas or viharas (monastery). The caves
                are connected with the river by rock-cut staircases. The excavation activity was carried out in two
                different phases separated by an interval of about four centuries. The first phase coincides with the
                rule of the Satavahana dynasty from about the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE, while the second
                phase corresponds to the Basim branch of the Vakataka dynasty with their Asmaka and Rishika feudatories
                in the 5th to 6th centuries CE.</p>
            <p>Altogether, six caves (caves 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A) were excavated in the first phase by
                Hinayana/Theravadin followers of Buddhism, wherein Buddha was worshipped in an aniconic/symbolic form.
                These caves are simple and austere, and carry mural paintings sparsely. The chaityagrihas are
                characterized by a vaulted ceiling and an apsidal end, the fa√ßade dominated by a horseshoe-shaped
                window, known as chaitya window.</p>
            <p>In the second phase, the rupestral activity was dominated by the Mahayana followers of Buddhism, where
                Buddha was worshipped in an icon/idol form. The earlier caves were reused, and several new ones were
                excavated. The architectural forms of the earlier phase continued, however, with a renewed architectural
                and sculptural fervour. </p>
            <p>Ajanta Caves exemplifies one of the greatest achievements in ancient Buddhist rock-cut architecture. The
                artistic traditions at Ajanta present an important and rare specimen of art, architecture, painting, and
                socio-cultural, religious and political history of contemporary society in India. </p>
            <p><strong>Criterion (i): </strong>Ajanta is a unique artistic achievement.</p>
            <p><strong>Criterion (ii): </strong>The style of Ajanta has exerted a considerable influence in India and
                elsewhere, extending, in particular, to Java.</p>
            <p><strong>Criterion (iii): </strong>With its two groups of monuments corresponding to two important moments
                in Indian history, this rupestral ensemble bears exceptional testimony to the evolution of Indian art,
                as well as to the determining role of the Buddhist community, intellectual and religious foyers, schools
                and reception centres in India during the Satavahana and Vakataka dynasties.</p>
            <p><strong>Criterion (vi): </strong>Ajanta is directly and materially associated with the history of
                Buddhism.</p>
            <p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
            <p>Ajanta Caves includes all the elements necessary to express its Outstanding Universal Value, including
                the ensemble of these caves in its natural setting, sculptures, paintings, and epigraphs. It is of
                adequate size to ensure the complete representation of the features and processes that convey the
                intense art and architectural activity that continued for 800 years, reflecting Buddhist philosophy.</p>
            <p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p>
            <p>The authenticity of Ajanta Caves is expressed through the architectural forms of chaityagrihas and
                viharas as well as the schemes used in decorating these spaces, such as sculptures and painted panels
                depicting various Buddhist traditions. Its location and setting, as well as its materials and substance,
                are likewise authentically associated with the history of Buddhism and with two important eras in the
                history of India.</p>
            <p><strong>Protection and management requirements</strong></p>
            <p>The management of Ajanta Caves is with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), while the management of
                the buffer zone comes under stakeholders including the ASI, Forest Department, and Government of
                Maharashtra through various legislation such as the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and
                Remains Act (1958) and Rules (1959), Indian Forest Act (1927), and Forest Conservation Act (1980). </p>
